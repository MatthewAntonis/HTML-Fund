    <h1>Lady Blue by Tatsuro Yamashita</h1>
    <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
    <p>Whenever the new yellow moon.
        Rises high in the heavens.
        I can see you beside me, lady blue.</p>
    <p>Whenever the wind in the trees.
        Shares a soft little secret.
        Then I hear you beside me, lady blue</p>
    <p>You came from dreams.
        You're just a picture, I'm the artist.
        You were born of the longing in my heart.
        I signed my name, and you moved in your frame.
        My lady blue love, dream come true love.</p>
    <p>They locked me away, 'til the day.
        That I'll say don't see you.
        But our hearts have a window, lady blue.
        You came from dreams.
        You're just a picture, I'm the artist.
        You were born of the longing in my heart.
        I signed my name, and you moved in your frame.
        My lady blue love, dream come true love. </p>
    <p>We move with the moon, making love.
        While the wind keeps our secret.
        And I feel you beside me, lady blue.
        Yes I feel you beside me, lady blue.</p>
